/**
 * <pre>
 * It is similar with "Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree". But the difference here is we have no way to random access item in O(1).
 * 
 * If we build BST from array, we can build it from top to bottom, like
 * 1. choose the middle one as root,
 * 2. build left sub BST
 * 3. build right sub BST
 * 4. do this recursively.
 * 
 * But for linked list, we can't do that because Top-To-Bottom are heavily relied on the index operation.
 * There is a smart solution to provide an Bottom-TO-Top as an alternative way, 
 * http://leetcode.com/2010/11/convert-sorted-list-to-balanced-binary.html
 * 
 * With this, we can insert nodes following the listâ€™s order. So, we no longer need to find the middle element, 
 * as we are able to traverse the list while inserting nodes to the tree.
